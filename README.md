# Daily Planner
## Homework 5

I have created an online planner to help you stay on task on your busy lives. 
The planner is very straight forward and works as follows: 

- The first thing you'll see is the current date in the format ('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a') 

- Then you have the planner with time slots starting at the 9:00 hour and ending at 17:00 hour. 

- The input field is centered and the font is Coral for visibility purposes.

- The SAVE button allows you to easily save an entry which will be saved even if the tab in the browser is closed.

The most challenging part of this assigntment was figuring out how to work with moment.js.
